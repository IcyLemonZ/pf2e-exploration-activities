# pf2e-explorationActivities

Import the "Exploration Activities Request" macro from the PF2E Exploration Activities compendium. 

To request an Exploration Activity from a player/players, select them and run the macro. A popup will appear on their screen with a drop down for them to select an activity. The selected activity will be output to the chat. 

**this fork connects the module pf2e effects, and applies the effect from that module to the players token. (in addition to the chat message)**
to install replace the .js files in modules/pf2e-exploration-activites/scripts/ with the ones here.  Then replace the gm-activityRequest macro with the contents of  gm-activityRequest.js

if you want you can use player-exploration-effects-macro.js to trigger the dialog from a player.
