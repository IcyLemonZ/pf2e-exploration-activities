# pf2e-explorationActivities

Import the "Exploration Activities Request" macro from the PF2E Exploration Activities compendium. 

To request an Exploration Activity from a player/players, select them and run the macro. A popup will appear on their screen with a drop down for them to select an activity. The selected activity will be output to the chat. 

**this fork connects the module pf2e effects, and applies the effect from that module to the players token. (in addition to the chat message)**
